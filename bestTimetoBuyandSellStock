Problem: "You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0."
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0;
        int minPrice=prices[0];
        for(int j=1;j<prices.length;j++){
            if(prices[j]<minPrice)
                minPrice = prices[j];
            else if(prices[j]-minPrice>0){
                int profit = prices[j]-minPrice;
                if(maxProfit<profit)
                    maxProfit = profit;
                }
